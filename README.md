# RELIX ReScript Dialect
RELIX ReScript is a simple and easy to use scripting language for use on [Internet Relay Chat](https://www.irchelp.org/). It is 
based firmly on the work of [Thomas Gatzweiler](https://github.com/proty/proty). As of 2024, the project is in its alpha stage.
The author hopes to transform and innovate the original concept into something that will be robust enough to handle the demands of
chatterboxes all over the world.

## Getting started with RELIX/RSD!
The project comes with two executables: a REPL interactive client (`irlx`) and a command-line utility (`rlxc`). The project started
with little documentation of the actual language, so referencing the `parser.y` is required at this time.

## Yet Another Programming Language (YAPL)?
The acronym YAPL seems to fit this project well. How many levels of abstraction are there in programming languages, anyway?!

## Brief History of RELIX ReScript Dialect
The author found the original source code for this project on GitHub while doing research on the nature of virtual stack machines
and the systems that are built around them, and generally how a complex ecosystem develops around novel languages. The project
began as an adaptation of what Thomas Gatzweiler wrote and left in 2012. This is a fork of that unfinished project with all "the
usual refinements."
